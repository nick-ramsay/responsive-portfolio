                My name is Nick Ramsay. 
                I'm currently a student at the University of Sydney's Full Stack Coding Bootcamp.
                I'm originally from the northeastern United States but now live and work in Australia.  
                After graduating from university in 2011, I've been working in the electronic health record industry.
                My areas of focus have largely been in business and data analysis, product design, and implementation.

                Growing up in the Appalachian Mountains of Northern New Hampshire, I enjoy all sorts of outdoor activities.
                Some of my favourite activities include hiking, running, skiing, and snoeshoeing.
                Of course, the snow related activities have been hard to continue living in Australia.
                I also enjoy travelling and most recently visited Taiwan and Japan.

                I have many interests beyond coding. 
                I've been a lifelong history buff, studying history and economics at my university.
                I love keeping up with current events in the world, particularly international affairs and politics.
                I like a wide variety of music, everything from folk music to punk rock to classical.
